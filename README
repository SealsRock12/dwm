The Configuration Made
======================
This section describe the configurations I've made, mostly for myself.

The 'master' branch is for applying patches. Other configurations are provided
in the 'dwm-config' branch.

Patches Applied
---------------
Dwm provides a lot of patches, most of them however conflict with each other,
this due to they are all generated from the barebone of dwm.

This repo applies the following patches:
1. pango -- support xft and color texts, etc.
2. systray -- somehow makes life easier to have it.
3. tab -- transform the monocle layout into "tabbed".
4. autostart -- so that we can organize autostart apps in a script.
5. bstack -- sometimes I need the master to span horizontally.

dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

If you are going to use the default bluegray color scheme it is highly
recommended to also install the bluegray files shipped in the dextra package.


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
